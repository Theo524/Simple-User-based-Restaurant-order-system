### **Aims of the Program:**

The program aims to create an interactive restaurant menu system where users can log in, view the menu, place orders, and administrators can view user details. The system keeps track of user balances, ensures secure login, and manages orders.


### **Design:**


#### Class Diagram:

The Class Diagram illustrates the relationships between classes in the program.

* User Class:
    * Attributes: username, password, balance
* Order Class:
    * Attributes: items (list of ordered items)
    * Methods: add_item, calculate_total_cost
* RestaurantMenuApp Class:
    * Manages the entire application, including user authentication, order handling, and GUI creation.
    * Uses the User and Order classes for managing user data and orders.


### **Testing:**


#### Test Cases:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Test Case Description</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Expected Result</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Login with correct credentials
   </td>
   <td>Successful login and transition to the menu page
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Login with incorrect credentials
   </td>
   <td>Display an error message
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Place an order within available balance
   </td>
   <td>Successful order placement and balance deduction
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Place an order exceeding available balance
   </td>
   <td>Error message and no balance deduction
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>View user details as an admin
   </td>
   <td>Display a window with a table of user details
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



#### Results:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Test Case Description</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Test Result</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Login with correct credentials
   </td>
   <td>Passed
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Login with incorrect credentials
   </td>
   <td>Passed
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Place an order within available balance
   </td>
   <td>Passed
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Place an order exceeding available balance
   </td>
   <td>Passed
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>View user details as an admin
   </td>
   <td>Passed
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



### **Critique:**


#### What Worked:



* The program successfully implements user authentication, order placement, and administrative features.
* GUI design is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* Error handling provides informative messages for better user experience.
* The use of classes promotes modularity and maintainability.


#### What Didn't:



* The code could benefit from more comments to explain complex sections, especially for newcomers to understand the logic.
* The GUI layout could be further improved for responsiveness on different screen sizes.


#### What Could Have Been Improved:



* Incorporating more advanced GUI features such as tooltips, hover effects, and animations could enhance the overall user experience.
* Adding more extensive unit tests to cover edge cases and improve code reliability.

In conclusion, the program effectively achieves its primary objectives of creating a restaurant menu system. It demonstrates a good use of object-oriented programming and GUI design. However, there is room for improvement in terms of code documentation and GUI enhancements. Future developments could focus on refining the user interface and expanding functionalities to provide an improved restaurant management system.
